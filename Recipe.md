# Instruction for Red Velvet Cake
  - Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease round cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. (Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.)
  - Make the cake: 
  - Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
  - Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
  - With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.
  - Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cake spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cake need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cake may dry out. 
  - Remove cake from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cake must be completely cool before frosting.
# Instruction for Ermine Frosting
  - In a medium sized sauce pan, combine 5 tablespoons flour and 1 cup milk and constantly stir over medium heat until very thick, like pudding (8-10 minutes).
  - Remove from heat, place plastic wrap on top and cool to room temperature. Then transfer it to the fridge and chill for 1 hour.
  - Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream 1 cup sugar, 1 cup butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract on medium high speed until light and fluffy (3-5 minutes).
  - Add the completely cool flour mixture and continue beating until you get the consistency of whipped cream (3-5 minutes).
  - Fill, frost and decorate cake as desired.
